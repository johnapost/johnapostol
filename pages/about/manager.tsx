        <Paragraph>
          Some examples that come to mind; developers who proactively review
          code for their own benefit. Teammates who believe that quality is
          owned by everyone, especially themselves. Colleagues who respect their
          own time as well as others.

          <strong>Being a developer, not an engineer</strong>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Early in my career, I coveted the &lsquo;engineer&rsquo; title. I
          thought engineers were worth more. I thought it brought validation to
          what I was doing, what I was learning. Software engineering was a
          fancy way of referring to my craft.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Now, I understand that it was harmless vanity at best. At worst, it
          was gatekeeping. I think it distances the act of writing code from the
          value the code brings. I now prefer the title &lsquo;developer&rsquo;.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          üìà Engineers/developers/coders/programmers should strive to create
          value. All of our work should create value. We should not build things
          just because they can be built. We should not build things just
          because they are hard to build or because they are fancy.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          I strive for my team to build right-sized solutions &mdash; using
          small changes by default. Our code should be predictable and pragmatic
          to avoid headaches. We should be opportunistic in our solutions.

          You dictate the cadence, the time of day, and even the location. Some

          project goes off the rails.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          I tend to overcommunicate, especially on important things. I

          I believe in asynchronous communication through technology. I treat
