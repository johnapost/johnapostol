Code reuse was arbitrary and difficult\nOur frontend code had duplication stemming from over-eager classical inheritance patterns. There were multiple levels of inheritance that had to be traversed to understand how a certain page’s logic would differ from another, very similar page.\n\nThis got worse with time.\n\n![left: alt text](static/2019-05-07/hero.jpg)\n\nTemplate functionality requirements were fluid. It was hard for newer hires to conform to the intricate inheritance layers when making changes.
