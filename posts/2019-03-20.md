This is a step-by-step guide to building your own serverless React app with the practicality afforded by Next.js and the Firebase ecosystem.

After reading about Next.js’s new serverless mode and attending ServerlessDays ATX, I got the itch to wire up a simple example for a Firebase-flavored serverless app.

**Read before you proceed: Firebase bundles all of your functions together and doesn’t natively support per-function bundling. A sufficiently large app with many routes may run into scaling issues. [See this comment.](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/1163#issuecomment-472071855)**

I wrote this all before I found this out so I’m publishing this anyway. Proceed if you dare!

First, let's take a look at our toolbox.

## Next.js

If you’ve ever built a major React app from scratch, you know what config hell it can be. Next.js is an opinionated, fully-featured React framework that gives you sane defaults upfront. Later on, you can customize your .babelrc and webpack config to suit your app’s needs. You can even pre-render your app on the server (or function in our case).

Most important for our purposes, Next.js features a new serverless mode that’s optimized for cold starts and small function size.

## Firebase Functions

*AKA Cloud Functions for Firebase*

Can’t have serverless functions without a serverless hosting provider. There’s servers running our code somewhere but we want them abstracted away.

The Firebase platform is a nice choice, because it can scale with your app’s needs for a data store, authentication, logging (albeit simple), static file hosting, and user file storage. There’s a little bit of a learning curve when integrating with some features but I’ve generally found it simpler to work with when compared to something like AWS.

*That said, permissions are currently platform-wide with beta support for per-function IAM. Be wary if you’re keen on following the principle of least privilege.*

The rest of this post will explain how to set everything up step-by-step. If you’d rather get going with less hand-holding, see this repo instead:

# From scratch

Fire up your text editor and `mkdir` something fancy, then let’s get started!

Begin by installing or swapping over to Node.js 8. Use the version of `npm` bundled with that to run these commands.

1. `npm init`
2. `npm install next react react-dom`
