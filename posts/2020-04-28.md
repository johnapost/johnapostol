# Personal Context

I had planned for 2020 to be the most important year in my career. This was the year to solidify my career goals concretely beyond "work with great people and make great things."

I have a career in tech across corporations and startups of varying sizes. I know what kind of teams I want to work with and what kind of teams I want to avoid. For a while, these were the biggest career problems I faced. After a few proving years, having a well-paying job as a programmer in tech felt like a given. Privileged, I know.

Now I sit on Zoom calls for part of the week, interviewing similarly-skilled and competent people. Many of them were laid off from their jobs, with one key difference between their economic uncertainty and my own situation.

I work for a company less impacted by the global pandemic than the company they had worked for.

# Be Organized

COVID-19 has ravaged everyone's plans. In the worst cases, it's taken lives and economic security. In these times of uncertainty, leaders remain important examples for their teams. Beyond giving a damn and providing assurances, we serve as guides for teams navigating confusion and anxiety.

Now, more than at any other time, it's important to be organized in thought and action. This is not the time for chaos. People leaders need to provide a foundation for their team to succeed.

> This is not the time for chaos.

In my case, this meant ditching my outdated note-taking system. Take some time from typical priorities and invest in your organizing your thoughts. **I wholeheartedly recommend using Notion, by the way.**

Every modern worker should have a note-taking platform with a smart searching feature. After migrating to Notion, I only need to remember a key phrase or topic in order to find hidden footnotes from otherwise uneventful status meetings.

Along with taking better notes, I also started taking *more notes*. Where I had been more freewheeling with my announcements, I was now preparing statements and reviewing them to make sure I communicated with purpose.

Unlike before where I was more apt to act upon feedback with immediacy, I have been more meticulous. I note feedback, the date it was given, and other context around it. This is to avoid making decisions in the heat of the moment. Where possible, leaving space for consideration leads to better decisions; something my team benefits from.

A lot of us are working remotely for the first time. Whether we express it or not, we are anxious; sizing up own economic welfare and wondering how to work effectively. Our teams are feeling this too. We should first put good effort into organizing ourselves. People benefit from any structure that leaders can given them.

Having a disorganized leader is stressful. We must free our team of that stress.

# Encourage Interaction

Acknowledge

Be available, 1:1s and in group settings, formal and informal

Be human, link to an outside article for thought leadership

# Overcommunicate

Check and double-check

Ask for feedback, often and in various ways

Talk about outlining priorities and providing a vision for the team

**A good leader is a shock absorber that cushions the blows of change.**

I've gotten over the initial year hump of technical people management. The training wheels have come off! I'm finally past the point where I wonder if I'm suited for the job. It's mine now and I have people depending on me to be good at it.
