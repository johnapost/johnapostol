## Identifying the problems

As our app grew, we had to support more CMS templates that were used for even more pages. Common bugs would appear and reappear as we worked. Problems fell into two categories.

### 1. Code reuse was arbitrary and difficult

Our frontend code had duplication stemming from over-eager classical inheritance patterns. There were multiple levels of inheritance that had to be traversed to understand how a certain page’s logic would differ from another, very similar page.

This got worse with time.
