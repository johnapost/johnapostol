This was the year to solidify my career goals concretely beyond \"work with great people and make great things.\"\n\nI have a career in tech across corporations and startups of varying sizes. I know what kind of teams I want to work with and what kind of teams I want to avoid. For a while, these were the biggest career problems I faced. After a few proving years, having a well-paying job as a software engineer in tech felt like a given. Privileged, I know.\n\nNow I sit on Zoom calls for part of the week, interviewing similarly-skilled and competent people. Many of them were laid off from their jobs, with one key difference between their economic uncertainty and my own situation.\n\nI work for a company less impacted by the global pandemic than the company they had worked for.\n\n---\n\n# Be Organized\n\nThe pandemic has ravaged everyone's plans. In the worst cases, it's taken lives and economic security. In these times of uncertainty, leaders remain important examples for their teams. Beyond giving a damn and providing assurances, we serve as guides for teams navigating confusion and anxiety.\n\nNow, more than at any other time, it's important to be organized in thought and action. This is not the time for chaos. People leaders need to provide a foundation for their team to succeed.\n\n> This is not the time for chaos.\n\nIn my case, this meant ditching my outdated note-taking system. I recommend everyone take some time from typical priorities and invest in organizing their thoughts. **I wholeheartedly recommend using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for this.**\n\nEvery modern worker should have a note-taking platform with a smart searching feature. After migrating to Notion, I only need to remember a key phrase or topic in order to find hidden footnotes from otherwise uneventful status meetings.\n\nAlong with taking better notes, I also started taking *more notes*. Where I had been more freewheeling with my announcements, I was now preparing statements and reviewing them to make sure I communicated with purpose.\n\nUnlike before where I was more apt to act upon feedback with immediacy, I have been more meticulous. I note feedback, the date it was given, and other context around it. This is to avoid making decisions in the heat of the moment. Where possible, leaving space for consideration leads to better decisions; something our teams benefit from.\n\nA lot of us are working remotely for the first time. Whether we express it or not, we are anxious; sizing up own economic welfare and wondering how to work effectively. Our teams are feeling this too. We should first put good effort into organizing ourselves. People benefit from any structure that leaders can given them.\n\nHaving a disorganized leader is stressful. We must free our team of that stress.\n\n# Be Available\n\nIn my Notion dashboard for my team, I have enshrined a little note to myself, **Quarantine; be human**. I credit this with keeping me grounded in reality.\n\nMost days, I start my work day by saying hello to my international reports first. There's a 6 hour timezone difference between us. We've had a remote working relationship since way before the global pandemic, but that doesn't make the situation any less strange for them. A simple, human greeting in the morning bridges us and provides a human tether we can both depend on.\n\nAs I noticed the team's online Slack indicators turned green, I would say hello. It's something easy to take for granted when working in the same physical space. Don't turn this into a work update, and don't neglect doing this.\n\nI also immediately instituted optional working calls every day, once in the morning and once again after lunch. When my company instituted remote working by choice, and then by mandate, I was worried about whether the team would be able to remain as tight knit and productive. I was worried work would become formulaic and stuffy.\n\nThe optional Zoom calls were a haven for the socially restless like myself and a few of the engineers. Team members were encouraged to join in if they wanted to chat. A message would go out in Slack and a few of us would jump on to joke and chat.\n\n> ..we all bought candlemaking kits and made them in our kitchens.\n\nI've been quite glad that our team has been able to have scheduled 'outings' still. In our last outing, we all bought candlemaking kits and made them in our kitchens. In making those kits, we learned about each others favorite smells (someone said cigarettes and gasoline) while the most experienced candlemaker answered our inane questions about wicks and heating wax.\n\nNext week, we will be onboarding an intern and keeping our tradition of team lunches for first days, even if we all have to order in and talk over Zoom. I can't wait.\n\nIn all these interactions I've worked to reinforce that we are still a community, we are still working together.
