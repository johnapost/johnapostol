As good stewards of our product, we satisfy reliability concerns by writing tests and pursuing QA standards. Routinely, we may find that developing a feature’s reliability takes longer than the actual work on the feature. If we find that the spec calls for a reliable feature, then we can allow for that time in our planning.\n\nMaybe we stop here. Our feature just needs to work and work reliably. For example, a progress bar for an internal file upload.

I would encourage focusing on high-impact changes or refactors that are measured with practicality. It would be awful for every feature to result in dozens of micro-optimizations to the architecture.\n\nOn the server side, now would be the time to consider caching strategies, reducing that important time-to-first-byte metric, and parallelizing asynchronous actions.\n\nFor those of us on the front end, we may want to optimize our assets. We can work with the UX team to tighten user feedback loops. These considerations help users stay engaged with our product.\n\nWith meaningful speed considerations applied to our feature, we can continue to the final clause.\n\nIt feels great!\n\nSoftware can’t feel great unless it works reliably and quickly.\n\nFor the features that have transcended the suitable performance threshold, we can begin the endless process of making it feel great. The idea is that we already have the necessary infrastructure in place to iterate successfully without continually having to get pulled back to the earlier clauses.\n\nAt this point, pursuing greatness is very specific to the project. It’s nebulous, and we should feel satisfied even to be at this point. Let’s optimize our multi-variant tests and discuss the finer points of Bezier curves for our transitions.
