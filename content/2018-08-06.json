Each feature is an opportunity to create a well-measured solution to a problem. In modern software development, we aren't just asked to solve these problems. We are also expected to delight our users.\n\nI've found that when our job is to delight users, we can get lost in details. Mapping data from a database to UI elements on the screen is easier than ever. We're tempted to rush through simple problems to spend extra time on more flashy interaction effects or ultra-efficient code.\n\nSometimes that results in unreliable code with a pretty veneer.\n\n...\n\nIt works fast, it's reliable, it's fast, and it feels great!\n\nThat simple mental priority list helps me focus and refocus as I work. I believe it can be useful to others working on product features. Let’s step through it.\n\nIt works.\n\nThe most important part of writing software is writing **working** software. The entire priority list depends on this clause. All the industries we service depend on working software.\n\nLet’s put ourselves in a user’s mindset. Would you buy/install/use/care about software that doesn’t work?\nOur No. 1 priority is to write and deploy working software. For some, the work stops there. We’ve done our jobs. Mark it as complete and get that feature into production!\n\nOur colleagues in other parts of the business may think this is where we spend most of our time. Truthfully, it’s easy to create that assumption for ourselves as well. Sizing stories when sprint planning and setting deadlines for functionality is simpler if we only have to consider delivering basic working software.",
